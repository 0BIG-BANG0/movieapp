Here's a breakdown of what happens in your code:

this.setState Call:

javascript
Copy code
this.setState((preState) => {
  return {
    stars: preState.stars + 0.5,
  };
}, ()=> console.log("stars inside callback: ", this.state.stars));
this.setState is called with an updater function and a callback.
The updater function (preState) => { return { stars: preState.stars + 0.5 }; } takes the previous state (preState) as an argument and returns the new state. In this case, it increments the stars value by 0.5.
The second argument is a callback function, ()=> console.log("stars inside callback: ", this.state.stars), which will be executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.
Asynchronous Nature of this.setState:

this.setState does not immediately update this.state. Instead, it schedules an update and re-rendering of the component.
Because of this, the state change will not be reflected immediately after calling this.setState. The update will be batched and processed later by React.
Logging State Immediately After this.setState:

javascript
Copy code
console.log("stars: ", this.state.stars);
This line is executed immediately after calling this.setState, before the state update has been processed.
As a result, it logs the old value of this.state.stars, not the updated value.
Logging State Inside Callback:

javascript
Copy code
()=> console.log("stars inside callback: ", this.state.stars)
This callback is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.
Therefore, it logs the updated value of this.state.stars.
To summarize, the key points are:

this.setState updates the state asynchronously.
The immediate console.log logs the old state.
The callback inside this.setState logs the new state after the update.
Here is the order of execution:

this.setState is called, scheduling a state update.
console.log("stars: ", this.state.stars) logs the current state, which is the old value.
React processes the state update, re-renders the component, and then calls the provided callback.
console.log("stars inside callback: ", this.state.stars) logs the new state, which reflects the updated value.
Example of a typical output assuming the initial value of stars is 1:

yaml
Copy code
stars:  1
stars inside callback:  1.5
